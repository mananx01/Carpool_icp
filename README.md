## 🏆 The Problem It Solves
Traditional ride-sharing platforms charge high fees and rely on central authorities for payments and dispute resolution. **Instant Carpool** solves this by leveraging **blockchain technology** to ensure **fair pricing, decentralized control, and instant settlements.**

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Install **Node.js** & **npm**
- Install **Plug Wallet** (if using Plug authentication)

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/instant-carpool.git
cd instant-carpool
```

### 3️⃣ Start the Local ICP Network
```bash
dfx start --clean --background
```

### 4️⃣ Deploy Canisters Locally
```bash
dfx deploy
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Frontend
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🌍 Deploying to ICP Mainnet
### 1️⃣ Authenticate with ICP
```bash
dfx identity new my-identity
dfx identity use my-identity
dfx ledger create-canister my-wallet
```

### 2️⃣ Deploy Canisters
```bash
dfx deploy --network ic
```

### 3️⃣ Verify Deployment
```bash
dfx canister --network ic info ridesharing_backend
dfx canister --network ic info ridesharing_frontend
```

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- **Signature Errors** – Fixed by proper agent setup.
